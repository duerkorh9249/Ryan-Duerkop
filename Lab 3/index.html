        <h2>About the Breed</h2>
        <p>Some people want a new and shiny designer dog. 
            A pup that looks lit and possibly even a little extra to suit their 21st-century lifestyle. 
            Other people aren’t so concerned with new and flashy canine aesthetics. 
            They are seeking something a little more classic. 
            Something old enough that “old” will have to be spelled with an extra “e.” 
            For this special breed of dog owner, there’s only one option. 
            The Olde English Bulldogge is such a classic and old-timey designer dog that even the word “dog” comes with an extra “e.” 
            This is the perfect pup to suit anyone with a willfully analog lifestyle. 
            It goes well with a vinyl, VHS, scotch, and classic paperback collection.</p>

        <h2>What Training Looks Like</h2>
        <p>The Olde English Bulldogge is a smart dog that is easy to train, but it is important to establish yourself as the pack leader during your training sessions, as these dogs can be independent. 
            You will need to be positive, firm, and confident in your approach, but without being harsh. 
            Aversive training techniques are not only counterproductive, but they can damage the relationship you have with your dog. 
            Instead, rely on reward-based training that uses praise and treats as motivation. 
            A promise of their favorite yummies is sure to get your Olde English Bulldogge excited about training!</p>
