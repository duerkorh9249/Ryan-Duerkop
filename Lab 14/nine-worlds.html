            <h4>"Stanzas 1-5"</h4>
            <p>Hearing I ask | from the holy races,
                From Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;
                Thou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate
                Old tales I remember | of men long ago.</p>
            <p>I remember yet | the giants of yore,
                Who gave me bread | in the days gone by;
                Nine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree
                With mighty roots | beneath the mold.</p>
            <p>Of old was the age | when Ymir lived;
                Sea nor cool waves | nor sand there were;
                Earth had not been, | nor heaven above,
                But a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.</p>
            <p>Then Bur's sons lifted | the level land,
                Mithgarth the mighty | there they made;
                The sun from the south | warmed the stones of earth,
                And green was the ground | with growing leeks.</p>
            <p>The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south
                Her right hand cast | over heaven's rim;
                No knowledge she had | where her home should be,
                The moon knew not | what might was his,
                The stars knew not | where their stations were.</p>

        <section id="yggdrasil">
            <h3>yggdrasil</h3>
            <p>Yggdrasil is a tree central to the Norse concept of the cosmos. The tree's branches extend into various realms, and various creatures dwell on and around it. The gods go to Yggdrasil daily to assemble at their things, traditional governing assemblies. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well Uroarbrunnr in the heavens, one to the spring Hvergelmir, and another to the well Mommisbrunnr. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the dragon Nidhoggr, an unnamed eagle, and the stags Daiinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Durapror.</p>

            <h3>Jotunheimr</h3>
            <p>From Jotunheimr, the giants menace the humans in Midgard and the gods in Asgard. The river Ifing (Old Norse, afingr) separates Asgard, the realm of the gods, from Jotunheimr, the land of giants. Gastropnir, the protection wall to the home of Menglad, and arymheimr, home of ajazi, were both located in Jotunheimr, which was ruled by King Thrym. Gladsisvellir was a location in Jotunheimr, where lived the giant Gudmund, father of Hofund. Utgard was a stronghold surrounding the land of the giants.</p>

        <section id="svartalfar">
            <h3>Svartilfar</h3>
            <p>In Norse mythology, Svartailfar (Old Norse "black elves", sing. svartailfr), also called myrkoilfar ("dark elves", "dusky elves", "murky elves", sing. myrkoilfr), are beings who dwell in Svartalfheim (Svartailfaheimr, "home of the black-elves"). Both the svartailfar and Svartailfaheimr are primarily attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have noted that the svartailfar appear to be synonymous with the dwarves and potentially also the dokkoilfar ("dark elves"). As dwarfs, the home of the svartAilfar could possibly be another description for Nidavellir (NiA avellir, "dark fields").</p>
