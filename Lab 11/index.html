      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        The Galloping Goose was established in 1873 by my great-grandmother, Marike. She
        inherited from her father a 23 acre apple orchard and his prized goose Gertrude at the
        age of 16. In the beginning she would sell cider and pies on the edge of town to the
        villagers. Eventually she saved enough turn the farmhouse at the end of her land into
        The Galloping Goose. Over the last century The Galloping Goose has been handed
        down to the eldest daughter who keeps the legacy of the pub alive
